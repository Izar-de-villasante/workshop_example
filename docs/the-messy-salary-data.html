<p>This original data set is taken from the Payroll Data from online “<a href="https://data.ct.gov/Government/State-Employee-Payroll-Data-Calendar-Year-2015-thr/virr-yb6n/data" class="uri">https://data.ct.gov/Government/State-Employee-Payroll-Data-Calendar-Year-2015-thr/virr-yb6n/data</a>”, Which include Calendar Year 2015 through the most recent pay period for Connecticut state employees. We take the subset only for 2017 fiscal year, which include the information of more than 1.77 million observations and 38 variables. There are 102,101 employees listed there. For convenience of analysis, we randomly took 8500 employees from the original data. For our sampled data set (“state_empoyee_salary_data_2017.csv”), we are interested in the relationship between income with other variables like age, sex, ethnic, union and so on. We will focus on the full time employees who got 26 pay checks in 2017 fiscal year. First we will clean our sampled data set.</p>

<p>Now 3441 employees are included in our data set. These employees include both male and female, aged from 22 to 81, group into 8 different ethnics. They belong to 54 different Unions. The minimum total gross is $568.7 and maximum is $17530.3. Biweekly rate range from $25.78 to $12884.62.</p>
<p>As for this salary data, we will focus on the total gross income of these state employees. We are interested in the points such as:
How about the distribution of the total gross income?
Are male and female paid equally?
Is there any difference in total gross for different age and age group?
Do some ethnic group get better pay than the others?
What’s the most important factor effect the gross income for these state employees?</p>
<p>From previous plots of total gross, we need to transform total gross first.</p>

<p>The distribution of Gross.Log, transformation of Tot.Gross is closer to normality than Tot.Gross. The highest frequency of Gross.Log is round 8.</p>
<p>Highest frequency employees are aged between 45 and 50 years old. The distribution is close to bell shape.</p>

<p>From the information of pairwise comparison, the total different alpha beta index indicates that these 8 age groups are significantly different from each other in mean gross. The elder the age, the higher the gross income, except for age group between 80 and 90, its mean gross is the lowest comparing with all other age group.</p>

<p>Density plot shows blue male line is later than red female line, which means male has bigger log of gross than female in total. The density peak of female is earlier than male also tell the same story.
The total different alpha beta index indicates that these 2 sex groups are significantly different from each other in mean log of gross, male get higher gross income than female.</p>

<p>Both plots tell us that for other ethnic group except Asian, male have higher average gross than female. On average, Asian female earn similar as male. Amind male have more bigger log of gross than Amind female. From the point and line plot we can see the same situation for Pacif ethnic. Because of the tiny amount of PACIF employees, there is no ridge showing in the plot.</p>

</div>
<p>From the figure we can see that for both male and female, the pattern of above and below average for almost all of the union description are similar. The only difference is the difference in total standardized log value of gross for male and female. For example, for union UCHC Univ Hlth Professionals on top, administrative Clerical on the bottom and other two unions like service/maintenance and Correctional Officers, all these four unions have more standardized log value of gross below average, on the same time, female UCHC Univ Hlth Professionals, administrative Clerical and male service/maintenance and Correctional Officers get this value less comparing with the other gender in the same union. But for union Uconn Faculty and Engineer Scien Tech, or Health professional and Judicial Professional, more standardized log value of gross above average, but female Uconn Faculty and Engineer Scien Tech and male Health professional and Judicial Professional get less than the other gender in the same union.</p>

<p>In our data set, we have much more employees in white, but really little in Pacif. For both male and female, with increasing in age, log of gross increase slightly for all other ethnics but Nspec. For most ethnics, male and female have similar pattern for the relation between age and log of gross. For ethnic unknown and Amind, male’s log of gross increase faster than female, but for Asian, male’s log of gross increase slower than female.</p>

<p>LM model indicate that Average Gross is related with all factors including Age, Ethnic group, Sex, and Union description. ANOVA test illustrates Average Gross is significantly affected by all four factors, especially by age and sex.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.6</span> Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Total Gross is not statistically normally distributed. It skewed to left. After taking log transformation, it is more close to normality.</p></li>
<li><p>The elder the age, the higher the gross income, except for age group between 80 and 90.</p></li>
<li><p>On average, males earn more than females in the same age, ethnic, union.</p></li>
<li><p>The means of gross are significantly different for different ethnic groups. On average, Asian and white are the top two groups. PACIF and unknown are the last.</p></li>
<li><p>The real average total gross change from 6307 dollars bi-weekly to 3380, and to 2066 for high , middle and low gross group. High, middle and low gross group occupy 6%, 68%, and 26% of the total employees. White male occupy much bigger portion in high gross group, especially the elder white male.</p></li>
<li><p>Age group, Union description, Sex, and Ethnic group together will explained 50% of log variance of gross.</p></li>

<div class="exercise">
<p><span id="exr:unnamed-chunk-536" class="exercise"><strong>Exercise 10.1  </strong></span>Create a folder, download the data file “state_empoyee_salary_data_2017.csv” into it, and create an Rstudio project in the folder. Read in the data file, peak the structure of your data set and clean it step by step:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Select only columns of “EmplId.Empl.Rcd”, “Bi.Weekly.Comp.Rate”, “Age”, “Ethnic”, “Sex”, “Full.Part”, “City”, get summary information for all these variables. Make sure EmplId.Empl.Rcd, sex, ethnic to be factor, age and biweekly rate to be numeric.</p></li>
<li><p>Pick up full time employees in city “Hartford”.</p></li>
<li><p>Select only those employees with 26 pay checks for 2017 ficial year(Hint:Each employee has unique ID of “EmplId.Empl.Rcd”).</p></li>
<li><p>Remove sex group other than “F” and “M” if there is any. Hint:Use str() after droplevels().</p></li>
<li><p>Replace level of empty space in Ethnic.Grp as “unknown”.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove emplolyees with Bi.Weekly.Comp.Rate equal or less than zero if there is any.</p></li>
<li><p>Group your data set by EmplId.Empl.Rcd, Ethnic.Grp, Sex. For each employee, take round of mean age and mean of Bi.Weekly.Comp.Rate as Age and Bi.Weekly.Rate for your data set.</p></li>
<li><p>Show structure and summary of your data set.</p></li>
<li><p>Show the distribution of “Bi-Weekly Comp Rate” and “Age” using histogram and QQ plot. Test the normality. Transform by taking log value if it’s necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Using pie plot to show the distribution of Sex.</p></li>
<li><p>List the count number and percent of employees in each ethnic group.</p></li>
<li><p>Using scatter plot to view the relationship between average Bi-Weekly Comp Rate and Age, add regression line and give your interpretation.</p></li>
<li><p>Using box plot to view the relationship between average Bi-Weekly Comp Rate by Ethnic group.</p></li>
<li><p>Using density plot to view the distribution of Bi-Weekly Comp Rate for different sex group, package ggplot2 is refered.</p></li>
<li><p>Do ANOVA test to check whether male are the same as female in Bi-Weekly Comp Rate in city “Hartford”.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore the interaction of ethnic and sex to Bi-Weekly Comp Rate using density ridges plot and interpret your plot.</p></li>
