# Step into R programming--the iris flower dataset  

Learning objectives:

- Install R and Rstudio.
- Data frames.
- The absolute basics: import data, check data types, attach, and then plot and analyze using column names.

 
## Getting started

1.  Install R from [www.R-project.org](file:///I:\book\ch1\www.R-project.org).
    Choose the cloud server or any U.S. mirror site.

2.  Install RStudio Desktop from
    [www.RStudio.com](file:///I:\book\ch1\www.RStudio.com). Rstudio uses the R
    software in the background but provides a more user-friendly interface. R
    commands can be typed directly into the "Console" window. Or you can enter
    them in the "R Script" window and click the "Run" button. If you have an
    older version of R or Rstudio, I will recommend upgrading to the new
    version.

3.  Alternatively, you can use R and Rstudio through a web browser via [Rstudio
    Cloud.](https://rstudio.cloud/) Some universities also host their own
    Rstudio server on more powerful computers.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/img0100_Rstudio.png")
```

As a quick sample session, let's try all of these commands below in the Console window. If you understand all of these, you probably do not need this book. Consider more advanced books like [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). If it takes a few months to type these 243 characters,  try [www.RapidTyping.com](www.RapidTyping.com) first.  
```{r eval = FALSE}
head(iris)
str(iris)
summary(iris)
x <- iris[, 1:4]
head(x)
boxplot(x)
plot(x[, 3:4])
abline( lm(x[, 4] ~ x[, 3]) )
pairs(x)
stars(x)

PL <- x$Petal.Length
PL
barplot(PL)
hist(PL)
Species <- iris$Species
Species
pie( table(Species) )
boxplot(PL ~ Species )
summary( aov(PL ~ Species) )
```

## Data frames have rows and columns: the Iris flower dataset 
In 1936, Edgar Anderson collected data to quantify the geographic variation of
*Iris* flowers. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of the three
sub-species ( *Iris setosa*, *Iris virginica,* and *Iris versicolor*). Four
features were measured from each sample: the lengths and the widths of sepals
and petals, in centimeters (cm). This data is included in R software. Download
this dataset from
[GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gexijin/learnR/master/datasets/iris.csv),
and open it in Excel. Have a quick look at the data, think about what
distinguishes the three species? If we have a flower with sepals of 6.5cm long
and 3.0cm wide, petals of 6.2cm long, and 2.2cm wide, which species does it most
likely belong to? **Think** (!) for a few minutes while eyeballing the data at
Wikipedia. Getting familiar with this dataset is vital to follow this book.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.cap='Iris flower. Photo from Wikipedia.', fig.align='center' }
knitr::include_graphics("images/img0101_iris.png")
```

The downloaded iris data can be imported into R by selecting **Import Dataset**
in the **File** menu, and then choose **"From text(readr)..."**. As the default
settings work well in this case, we just need to click **Import** in the pop-up
window. That's it! There is no need to spend half of a semester to learn how to
import data like some people used to complain about SAS. If you have trouble
importin this data file, you can skip this step as this data set is included in
the R software.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap='Example of a data frame. ', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/img0102_dataframe.png")
```

To answer these questions, let’s visualize and analyze the data with R. Type these commands without the comments after “#”.  

```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
iris        # print the whole dataset
dim(iris)   # show the dimension of the data frame
head(iris)  # show the first few rows
str(iris)   # show the structure
```
```{r echo=TRUE}
class(iris)
```

While the first 4 columns contain **numeric** values, the 5^th^ column contains
**characters** indicating which sub-species a sample belongs to. This is an
important distinction, as they are treated differently in R. Sometimes we need
to overwrite data types guessed by R, which can be done during the data
importing process

The imported data is stored in a **data frame** called *iris*, which contains
both numeric and character columns. Individual values in a data frame can be
accessed using row and column indices. Another data structure is a **matrix**
which contains only one type of variables. More discussion about data frame,
matrix, and other data structures are introduced in the later chapters.

```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
iris[3, 4]    # shows the value in 3rd row, 4th column: 0.2.
iris[3, ]     # shows all of row 3
iris[, 4]     # shows all of column 4
iris[3, 1:4]  # shows row 3, columns 1 to 4
```

**To do the exercises, you need to creat a new Word document. Then copy and paste the R code and results to the Word document. Save it as a PDF file. Submit both the Word and PDF files to the Dropbox.**

>
```{exercise }
Type **data()** in the R Console window. The pop-up window - R data sets - contain all built-in data sets in package ‘datasets’. Choose a data set whose structure is data frame, then answer the following questions:

>
a. Display the first few rows of the data set. **NOT** all values in your data set.      
b. Show the dimension of the data set.        
c. Extract a subset which contains values in the 2nd through the 5th rows and the 1st through the 4th columns. If your data set contains fewer rows or columns, please choose another data set.
```


You can replace the **iris** data set with any of the built-in data sets as long as its data structure is **data frame**. Make sure you check the structure of the data set by the **class()** function. Note: You will need to change the variable names and ranges of rows and columns. 


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='45%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/img0100_tips.png")
```
```{r}
colnames(iris)  # Column names. 
```

Remember these column names, as we are going to use them in our analysis now. Note that sepal length information is contained in the column named **Sepal.Length**. Since R is case sensitive, we have to type these column names exactly as above. R is case-sensitive. “iris$petal.length” will not be recognized.
We can retrieve an entire column by using the data frame name followed by the column name.
```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
iris$Petal.Length  # The 150 numbers in the Petal length column
```

This is the recommended, safer way of referring to columns. But if you are as
lazy as me and do not want to type the data frame name repeatedly. This is a
shortcut by attaching a data frame the columns can be accessed directly. One
disadvantage is that it will be cause issues if two datasets
have the same variable names, or if the data is transformed. We typically do not recommend doing it but here we want to make things simple. 

```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
attach(iris)
Petal.Length  # The 150 numbers in the Petal length column
```


```{r}
mean(Petal.Length)   # mean( ) is a function that operates on Petal.Length
```

>
```{exercise}

>
a. Compute the mean of the sepal length in the data set **iris**.             
b. Compute the mean of speed in the built-in data set **cars**.
```


The best way to learn about other R functions is Google search. 

>
```{exercise}

>
a. Google “R square root function” to find the R function, and compute the value of $\sqrt{56.7}$.     
b. Use R to find the maximal value of mpg in the data set **mtcars**. 
```


## Analyzing one set of numbers

First, let's retrieve the 150 in the nubmerspetal length column and store it in
an vector called x.
```{r}
x <- Petal.Length   
```

Some might complain that nothing happens after you type in this command.
Although nothing is printed out, you have created a new **vector** called x in
the memory. You can find it in the top right panel in the **Environment** tab.
*The process of programming is all about creating and modifying data objects;
these data objects can be printed out or operated on.*

**A vector** holds a series of values, such as numbers and characters. R made it
very easy to do the same calculations (add, subtract, multiply,...) on all of
them at once or collectively.

```{r}
summary(x)
```

This produces a lot of useful information.

-   The minimum petal length is 1.0, and the maximum is 6.9.

-   Average petal length is 3.758.

-   The mid-point, or median, is 5.35, as about half of the numbers are smaller
    than 5.35. Why the median is different from the mean? What happens if there
    is a typo and one number is entered 340cm instead of 3.40cm?

-   The 3rd quartile, or 75^th^ percentile, is 5.1, as 75% of the flowers have
    petals shorter than 5.1. If a student's GPA ranks 5^th^ in a class of 25,
    he/she is at 80^th^ percentile.
    
-   The 1st quartile, or 25^th^ percentile, is 1.6. Only 25% of the flowers have
    petals shorter than 1.6. These summary statistics are graphically
    represented as a boxplot in the Figure \<span class="redoc"
    id="redoc-citation-1"\>@ref(fig:1-3)A. Boxplots are more
    useful when multiple sets of numbers are compared.

(ref:1-3) Boxplot of petal length (A) and of all 4 columns (B). 

```{r 1-3, echo=c(1, 5), fig.show='hold', out.width='50%', fig.cap='(ref:1-3)', fig.align='center'}
boxplot(x)   # Figure 1.3A.
text(x = 1, y = c(5.2, 4.5, 1.75), labels = c("75th pencentile", "Median", "25th pencentile"))
text(1.45, 6.6, labels = "boxplot(x)", col = "red")
legend("topleft", inset = .02, legend = "A",  box.lty = 0)
boxplot(iris[, 1:4])  # boxplot Figure 1.3B.
text(4.1, 7.5, labels = "boxplot(iris[, 1:4])", col = "red")
legend("topleft", inset = .001, legend = "B",  box.lty = 0)
```

In Rstudio, you can copy a plot to the clipboard using the **Export** button on
top of the plot area. Or you can click **zoom**, right click on the popup plot
and select **"Copy Image"**. Then you can paste the plot into Word. If you are
using native R software, instead of Rstudio, you can right-click on the plots
and copy as meta-file.

>
```{exercise}
a. Check the data structure of the built-in data set mtcars.     
b. Get the boxplot of Mile Per Gallon (mpg) in the data set mtcars.
```

  
To quantify the variance, we can compute the **standard deviation** σ:
\begin{align}
σ=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1}[(x_{1}-\bar x)^2+(x_{2}-\bar x)^2+...+(x_{N}-\bar x)^2]}    
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
\bar x=\frac{1}{N}(x_{1}+x_{2}+...x_{N})
\end{align}
If all the measurements are close to the mean (µ), then standard deviation should be small. 

```{r}
sd(x)  # standard deviation
sd(Sepal.Width) 
```

As we can see, these flowers have similar sepal width, but they differ widely in
petal length. This is consistent with the boxplot above. Perhaps changes in
petal length lead to better survival in different habitats.

With R, it is easy to generate graphs.
```{r out.width='80%', fig.cap='Barplot of petal length', fig.align='center'}
barplot(x)
```

This figure suggests that the first 50 flowers (Iris setosa) have much shorter
petals than the other two species. The last 50 flowers (Iris virginica) have
slightly longer petals than the middle (Iris versicolor).

(ref:1-4) Sequence plot, histogram, lag plot and normal Q-Q plot. 

```{r 1-4, echo=c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8), fig.show='hold', out.width='50%', fig.cap='(ref:1-4)', fig.align='center'}
plot(x)  # Run sequence plot
legend("topleft", inset = .02, cex = 2, legend = "plot(x)",  box.lty = 0)
hist(x)  # histogram
legend(1.6, 36, cex = 2, legend = "hist(x)",  box.lty = 0)
lag.plot(x)
legend("topleft", inset = .02, cex = 2, legend = "lag.plot(x)",  box.lty = 0)
qqnorm(x)  # Q-Q plot for normal distribution
qqline(x) 
legend("topleft", inset = .02, cex = 2, legend = "qqnorm(x)",  box.lty = 0)
```

Histogram shows the distribution of data. The histogram top right of Figure \@ref(fig:1-4) shows that there are more flowers with Petal Length between 1 and 1.5.  It also shows that the data does not show a bell-curved distribution.

The lag plot is a scatter plot against the same set of number with an offset of
1. Any structure in a lag plot indicates non-randomness in the order in which
the data is presented. We can clearly see three big clusters, indicating that
values are centered around three levels sequentially.

Q-Q plot can help check if data follows a Gaussian distribution, which is widely observed in many situations. Also referred to as normal distribution, it is the pre-requisite for many statistical methods. See Figure \@ref(fig:1-5) for an example of normal distribution. Quantiles of the data is compared against those in a normal distribution.   If the data points on a Q-Q plot form a straight line, the data has a normal distribution.


>
```{exercise}
a. Run x = rnorm(500) to generate 500 random numbers following the Standard Normal distribution    
b. generate scatter plot, histogram, lag plot, and Q-Q plot. Your plots should like those in Figure \@ref(fig:1-5).      
```


(ref:1-5) Plots for randomly generated numbers following a normal distribution. 

```{r 1-5, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', out.width='50%', out.length='50%', fig.cap='(ref:1-5)', fig.align='center'}
x <- rnorm(500)
plot(x)   # Run sequence plot    
hist(x)   # histogram
lag.plot(x)
qqnorm(x)  #Q-Q plot for normal distribution
qqline(x) 
```


>
```{exercise}
Generate scatter plot, histogram, lag plot, and Q-Q plot for the Septal length in the iris dataset.
```


We can also do a one-sample t-test of mean:
```{r}
t.test(Sepal.Length, mu = 5.8)
```

In this case, our hypothesis is that the true average of sepal length for all iris flowers is 5.8.   Since p-value is quite big, we accept this hypothesis. This function also tells us the 95% confidence interval on the mean. Based on our sample of 150 iris flowers, we are 95% confident that the true mean is between 5.71 and 5.98. 

>
```{exercise}
Compute 95% confidence interval of petal length. 
```


We can perform hypothesis testing on whether a set of numbers derived from normal distribution. The null hypothesis is that the data is from a normal distribution. 
```{r}
shapiro.test(Petal.Length)
```

If petal length is normally distributed, there is only 7.412×10^-10^ chance of getting a test statistic of 0.87627, which is observed in our sample of 150 flowers. In other words, it is highly unlikely that petal length follows a normal distribution. We reject the normal distribution hypothesis.

>
```{exercise}
a. Run Shapiro’s test on sepal width. Does it follow a normal distribution given the significant level is 0.05?    
b. Generate histogram and Q-Q plot for sepal width. Do the plots show a Normal approximation?    
```


## Analyzing a column of categorical values

In the iris dataset, the last column contains the species information. These are “string” values or categorical values.  
```{r echo=c(1, 2, 3, 5), fig.show='hold', out.width='50%', fig.cap='Frequencies of categorical values visualized by Pie chart (A) and bar chart (B).', fig.align='center'}
counts <- table(Species)  # tabulate the frequencies
counts
pie(counts)  # See Figure 1.7A
legend("topleft", inset = .02, legend = "A",  box.lty = 0)
barplot(counts)  # See Figure 1.7B
text(3.71, 48, labels = "B")
```

Pie charts are very effective in showing proportions.

We can see that the three species are each represented with 50 observations.

## Analyzing the relationship between two sets of numbers 
Scatter plot is very effective in visualizing the correlation between two columns of numbers. 

(ref:2-1) Scatter plot of petal width and petal length.

```{r 2-1, message=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap='(ref:2-1)', fig.align='center'}
x <- Petal.Width  # just lazy
y <- Petal.Length 
plot(x, y)        # scatterplot,  refined version in Figure 1.9
```

Figure \@ref(fig:2-1) shows that there is a positive correlation between petal
length and petal width. In other words, flowers with longer petals are often
wider. So the petals are getting bigger substantially when both dimensions
increase.

Another unusual feature is that there seem to be two clusters of points. Do the
points in the small cluster represent one particular species of Iris? We need to
further investigate this. The following will produce a plot with the species
information color-coded. The resultant Figure \@ref(fig:2-2) clearly shows that
indeed one particular species, *I. setosa* constitutes the smaller cluster in
the low left. The other two species also show a difference in this plot, even
though they are not easily separated. This is a very important insight into this
dataset.

(ref:2-2) Scatter plot shows the correlation of petal width and petal length.

```{r 2-2, echo=c(1, 2), out.width='80%', fig.cap='(ref:2-2)', fig.align='center'}
plot(x, y, col = rainbow(3)[Species])  # change colors based on Species 
legend("topleft", levels(Species), fill = rainbow(3))  # add legends on topleft.
abline(lm(y ~ x))
```

There are 3 species, therefore we select 3 for the rainbow() function. The 3
colors will correspond the 3 species. The **class(Species)** returns the data
structure of Species is a "factor". The **levels(Species)** function shows all
levels of Species. The function **str(Species)** shows that the Species is a
factor with 3 levels which are internally coded as 1, 2, and 3.

```{r}
class(Species)  # Show the data structure of Species.
levels(Species) # Show all levels of a factor variable.
str(Species)    # show the structure of Species.
```

Perhaps due to adaption to the environment, change in petal length leads to
better survival. With the smallest petals, *Iris Setosa* is found in Arctic
regions. *Iris versicolor* is often found in the Eastern United States and
Eastern Canada. *Iris virginica* "is common along the coastal plain from Florida
to Georgia in the Southeastern United States \[Wikipedia\]." It appears the iris
flowers in warmer places are much larger than those in colder ones. With R, it
is very easy to generate lots of graphics. But we still have to do the thinking.
It requires to put the plots in context.

The **mtcars** data description can be found here: [https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/RHOME/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/RHOME/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html).

Based on mtcars data set, plot a scatter plot which shows the correlation between Miles/(US) gallon and Displacement (cu.in.). In this data set, the type of cyl is numeric. You will need to use function newcyl -> factor(cyl) to transfer the type to factor. Then replace all mtcars$cyl with newcyl.
>
>
- Color the scatter plot by Number of cylinders;
- Add legend to the top right.
```


We can quantitatively characterize the strength of the correlation using several types of correlation coefficients, such as Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r.  It ranges from -1 to 1.   
```{r}
cor(x, y) 
```

This means the petal width and petal length are strongly and positively correlated.
```{r}
cor.test(x, y)
```

Through hypothesis testing of the correlation, we reject the null hypothesis that the true correlation is zero. That means the correlation is statistically significant.
Note that Pearson’s correlation coefficient is not robust against outliers and other methods such as Spearman’s exists. See help info:
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
?cor  # show help info on cor ( )
```
We can also determine the equation that links petal length and petal width. This is so called regression analysis. We assume

         $Petal.Length = a × Petal.Width + c + e$, 
         
where $a$ is the slope parameter, $c$ is a constant, and $e$ is some random error.   This linear model can be determined by a method that minimizes the least squared-error:
```{r}
model <- lm(y ~ x)  # Linear Model (lm)
summary(model)      # shows the details
```

As we can see, we estimated that *a*=2.22944 and *c*=1.08356. Both parameters are significantly different from zero as the p-values are <2×10^-16^ in both cases. In other words, we can reliably predict 

$Petal.Length = 2.22944 × Petal.Width + 1.08356$.

This model can be put on the scatter plot as a line.
```{r fig.keep='none'}
plot(model)
abline(model)  # add regression line to plot. Figure 1.8.
```

Sometimes, we use this type of regression analysis to investigate whether variables are associated.

```



## Testing the differences between two groups
Are boys taller than girls of the same age? Such situations are common. We have measurements of two groups of objects and want to know if the observed differences are real or due to random sampling error.   

(ref:2-4) Boxplot of petal length, grouped by species.

```{r  message=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap='(ref:2-4)', fig.align='center'}
boxplot(Petal.Length ~ Species)  
```


From the boxplot, it is obvious that *I. Setosa* has much shorter petals. But are there significant differences between *I. versicolor* and *I. virginica*?  We only had a small sample of 50 flowers for each species. But we want to draw some conclusion about the two species in general. We could measure all the iris flowers across the world; Or we could use statistics to make inference. First we need to extract these data
```{r results='hide'}
x <- Petal.Length[51:100]  # extract Petal Length of iris versicolor
x  # x contain 50 measurements
y <- Petal.Length[101:150]  # extract Petal length of iris virginica
y  # y contain 50 measurements
```

```{r fig.keep='none'}
boxplot(x, y)  # a boxplot of the two groups of values
t.test(x, y)
```
In this student’s t-test, our null hypothesis is that the mean petal length is the same for *I. versicolor* and *I. virginica*. A small p-value of 2.2x10^-16^ indicates under this hypothesis, it is extremely unlikely to observe the difference of 1.292cm through random sampling. Hence we reject that hypothesis and conclude that the true mean is different. If we measure all *I. versicolor* and *I. virginica* flowers in the world and compute their true average petal lengths, it is very likely that the two averages will differ. On the other hand, if p-value is larger than a threshold, typically 0.05, we will accept the null hypothesis and conclude that real average petal length is the same. 

We actually do not need to separate two set of numbers into two data objects in order to do t-test or compare them side-by-side on one plot. We can do it right within the data frame. R can separate data points by another column.
```{r results='hide', fig.keep='none'}
x2 <- iris[51:150, ]  # Extract rows 51 to 150
t.test(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = x2)  # t-test 
boxplot(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = droplevels(x2))  #removes empty levels in Species
```

>
```{exercise}
Use boxplot and t-test to investigate whether sepal width is different between I. versicolor and I. virginica. Interpret your results.
```


## Testing the difference among multiple groups (ANOVA)
As indicated by Figure \@ref(fig:2-4), sepal width has small variation across species. We want to know if the mean sepal width is the same across 3 species. This is done through Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).

(ref:2-5) Boxplot of sepal width across 3 species.

```{r 2-5, echo=c(1,3), fig.cap='(ref:2-5)', fig.align='center'}
boxplot(Sepal.Width ~ Species)  # Figure 1.12
text(2.5, 4.2, labels = "boxplot(Sepal.Width~Species)", col = "red")
summary(aov(Sepal.Width ~ Species))
```
Since p-value is much smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. The mean sepal width is not the same for 3 species. This is the only thing we can conclude from  this. The boxplot in Figure \@ref(fig:2-5) seems to indicate  that *I. Setosa* has wider sepals.

I hope this give you some idea about what it is like to using R to visualize and analyze data. It is interactive and graphical interface make it easy to manipulate data.
