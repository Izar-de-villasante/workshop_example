# Step into R programming--the iris flower dataset  

Learning objectives:

- Use R from [Rstudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) or local install.
- RStudio interface: Console, Script, Environment, Plots.
- Data frames and vectors.
- The basics workflow: import data, check data types, define vectors from columns, plot and analyze.

 
## Getting started 
1.  You can use R and Rstudio through a web browser via [Rstudio
    Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/). Create a free account, or just log-in with your Google account. Click the "New Project" button to get started. 

2.  Alternatively, you can install R on your laptop from [www.R-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org/). Then install RStudio Desktop from
    [www.RStudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). If you have an
    older version of R or Rstudio, we recommend uninstall them, delete the folder that holds the R packges, and reinstall the latest versions.
    

```{r Rinterface, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap='Interface of RStudio.', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/img0100_Rstudio.png")
```


RStudio uses R
in the background but provides a more user-friendly interface. R
commands can be typed directly into the "Console" window.  See Figure \@ref(fig:Rinterface). 

As a quick sample session, try all of these commands below in the Console window. 
R is case-sensitive; "Species" and "species" are two different variables. 
If you understand all of these, you probably do not need this book; 
consider more advanced books like [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). 
If it takes you a few months to type these 248 characters, try [www.RapidTyping.com](www.RapidTyping.com) first.  
```{r eval = FALSE}
head(iris)
str(iris)
summary(iris)
df <- iris[, 1:4]
boxplot(df)
pairs(df)
stars(df)

PL <- df$Petal.Length
barplot(PL)
hist(PL)
SP <- iris$Species
pie(table(SP))
boxplot(PL ~ SP)
summary(aov(PL ~ SP))

PW <- df$Petal.Width
plot(PL, PW, col = SP)
abline(lm(PW ~ PL))
```

## The proper way of using RStudio

1.  Create a project. An RStudio project is a nice way to organize and compartmentalize different tasks. The idea is, for a new research project, 
we put all related files (source code, data, results) into a designated folder. 
 On RStudio.cloud, you have to do this to initiate an R session. 
Click on the "Untitled Project" on the top of the window to rename it as something meaningful, such as "Workshop".  
If you are running R locally, click File from the main menu, and select New Project. 
Then follow directions to choose or create a folder. 

2.  Create a script file by going to File -> New File -> R Script. Or click on the green plus sign. 
Instead of typing our commands directly into the console window, we will type  in the "R Script" window, which could be saved as a record.
To execute one line of code, click anywhere in the line and click the "Run" button. You can also highlight and run a block of code. 
Type these two lines in the Script window, save the script as Workshop_script.R. Then click on each line and click **Run** from the icon. 
After that, select both lines and click **Run**. 
```{r eval = FALSE}
head(iris)
plot(iris)
```

3.  Copy file into project folder.  Download this dataset from
[GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gexijin/learnR/master/datasets/iris.csv) and save it as iris.csv.  

## Data frames contain rows and columns: the iris flower dataset 
In 1936, Edgar Anderson collected data to quantify the geographic variations of
[*iris* flowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iris_flower_data_set). 
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of the three
sub-species ( *iris setosa*, *iris virginica,* and *iris versicolor*). Four
features were measured in centimeters (cm): the lengths and the widths of both sepals
and petals. This is one of many built-in datasets in R. Download
this dataset from
[GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gexijin/learnR/master/datasets/iris.csv),
and open it in Excel. Have a quick look at the data, think about what
distinguishes the three species. If we have a flower with sepals of 6.5cm long
and 3.0cm wide, petals of 6.2cm long, and 2.2cm wide, which species does it most
likely belong to? **Think** (!) for a few minutes while eyeballing the data. 
Write down your guessed species.
Getting familiar with this dataset is vital for this and next chapters.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.cap='iris flower. Photo from Wikipedia.', fig.align='center' }
knitr::include_graphics("images/img0101_iris.png")
```

If you are using [Rstudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) through a web browser, 
you are using a computer on the cloud, which cannot directly access your local files. 
Therefore you need to first upload 
the data file to the cloud using the **Upload** button in 
the **Files** tab in the lower right panel. 

The data file can be imported into R by selecting **Import Dataset**
in the **File** menu, and then choose **"From Text(base)..."**.  As the default
settings work well in this case, we just need to click **Import** in the pop-up
window. That's it! There is no need to spend half of a semester to learn how to
import data, like some people used to complain when learning SAS. If you have trouble
importing this data file, you can skip this step as this data set is included in R.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap='Example of a data frame.', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/img0102_dataframe.png")
```

To answer these questions, let us visualize and analyze the data with R. **Type these commands without the comments marked by “#”.**  
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
View(iris) # show as a spreadsheet
```
```{r echo=TRUE}
head(iris) # first few rows
class(iris) # show the data type
str(iris) # show the structure
```

The imported data is stored in a **data frame** called *iris*, which contains
information of 5 variables for 150 observations (flowers). While the first 4 variables/columns, 
*Sepal.Length*, *Sepal.Width*, *Petal.Length*, and *Petal.Width*, contain **numeric** values. 
The 5^th^ variable/column, *Species*, contains
**characters** indicating which sub-species a sample belongs to. This is an
important distinction, as they are treated differently in R.  
Sometimes we need to overwrite data types guessed by R, which can be done during the data
importing process. If you are using the built-in iris data, the variable/column *Species* is a **factor** with three levels.

```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(iris) # summary statistics
```
The *summary* function provides us with information on the distribution of each variables. 
There are 50 observations for each of the three sub-species.

Individual values in a **data frame** can be accessed using row and column indices. 
```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
iris[3, 4] # returns the value lies at the intersection of row 3 and column 4
iris[3, ] # returns values of row 3
iris[, 4] # returns values of column 4
iris[3, 1:4] # returns values at the intersections of row 3 and columns from 1 to 4
```

**To do the exercises, you need to create a blank Word document. 
Copy-and-paste the R code and corresponding outputs to the Word document, 
and then save it as a PDF file. Submit both the Word and PDF files to the Dropbox.**

>
```{exercise }

>
Type **data()** in the R Console window. The pop-up window - R data sets - contain all built-in data sets in package **datasets**. Choose a data set whose structure is data frame, then answer the following questions:
>
a. Display the first few rows of the data set. **NOT** all values in your data set.      
b. Show the dimension of the data set.        
c. Extract a subset which contains values in the 2nd through the 5th rows and the 1st through the 4th columns. If your data set contains fewer rows or columns, please choose another data set.
```


You can replace the **iris** data set with any of the built-in data sets as long as its data structure is **data frame**. 
Make sure you check the type of the data set by using **class()** or **str()** function. 
Note: You will need to change the variable names and ranges of rows and columns. 


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='45%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/img0100_tips.png")
```
```{r}
colnames(iris) # Column names
```

Remember these column names, as we are going to use them in our analysis. Note that sepal 
length information is contained in the column named **Sepal.Length**. 
We can retrieve an entire column by using the data frame name followed by the column name. 
R is case-sensitive. “iris$petal.length” will not be recognized.
```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
iris$Petal.Length # 150 petal lengths
```

If this is too much typing, we can store the data in a new **vector** called PL.
```{r} 
PL <- iris$Petal.Length # define a new variable which contains only the Petal.Length values
```

Some might complain that nothing happens after you type in this command.
Although nothing is printed out, you have created a new **vector** called PL in
the memory. You can find it in the top right panel in the **Environment** tab. 
The process of programming is 
mostly creating and modifying data objects in the memory.  

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/environment.png")
```

Like money saved in a bank, these data can be retrieved and used:
```{r} 
PL  #print out 150 numbers stored in PL
mean(PL)  #mean, duh
```

>
```{exercise}

>
a. Compute the mean of the sepal length in the data set **iris**.             
b. Compute the mean of speed in the built-in data set **cars**.
```


The best way to find and learn R functions is Google search. The R community is uniquely supportive. 
There are many example codes and answers to even the dumbest questions on sites like [StackOverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/). 

>
```{exercise}

>
a. Google “R square root function” to find the R code, then compute the value of $\sqrt{56.7}$.     
b. Use R to find the maximal value of the variable *mpg* in the data set **mtcars**. 
```


## Analyzing one set of numbers

A **vector** holds a series of numbers or characters. Using various **functions**, R made it
very easy to do the same calculations (add, subtract, multiply,...) on all of
them at once or collectively.

```{r}
summary(PL)
```

This produces a lot of useful information about the distribution of petal length:

-   The minimum is 1.000, and the maximum is 6.900.

-   Average petal length is 3.758.

-   The mid-point, or median, is 4.350, as about half of the numbers are smaller
    than 4.350. Why the median is different from the mean? What happens if there
    is a typo and one number is entered 340cm instead of 3.40cm?

-   The 3rd quartile, or 75^th^ percentile, is 5.100, as 75% of the flowers have
    petals shorter than 5.100. If a student's GPA ranks 5^th^ in a class of 25,
    he/she is at 80^th^ percentile. The minimum is the 0^th^ percentile and the
    maximum is the 100^th^ percentile.
    
-   The 1st quartile, or 25^th^ percentile, is 1.600. Only 25% of the flowers have
    petals shorter than 1.600. These summary statistics are graphically
    represented as a boxplot in the Figure \@ref(fig:1-3)A. Boxplots are more
    useful when multiple sets of numbers are compared.

(ref:1-3) Boxplot of petal length (A) and of all 4 columns (B).

```{r 1-3, echo=c(1, 5), fig.show='hold', out.width='50%', fig.cap='(ref:1-3)', fig.align='center'}
boxplot(PL) # boxplot of Petal Length.
text(x = 1, y = c(5.2, 4.5, 1.75), labels = c("75th pencentile", "Median", "25th pencentile"))
text(1.45, 6.6, labels = "boxplot(PL)", col = "red")
legend("topleft", inset = .02, legend = "A", box.lty = 0)
boxplot(iris[, 1:4]) # boxplots of four columns of iris.
text(4.1, 7.5, labels = "boxplot(iris[, 1:4])", col = "red")
legend("topleft", inset = .001, legend = "B", box.lty = 0)
```

In RStudio, you can copy a plot to the clipboard using the **Export** button on
top of the plot area. Or you can click **zoom**, right click on the pop-up plot
and select **"Copy Image"**. Then you can paste the plot into Word. 

>
```{exercise}

>
a. Check the data structure of the built-in data set **mtcars**.     
b. Get the boxplot of Mile Per Gallon (*mpg*) in the data set **mtcars**.
```

  
To quantify the variance, we can compute the **standard deviation** σ:
\begin{align}
σ=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1}[(x_{1}-\bar x)^2+(x_{2}-\bar x)^2+...+(x_{N}-\bar x)^2]}    
\end{align}
where N is the sample size and
\begin{align}
\bar x=\frac{1}{N}(x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{N}) 

\end{align}
If all the measurements are close to the mean µ, then standard deviation should be small. 

```{r}
sd(PL) # standard deviation of Petal Length
SW <- iris$Sepal.Width
sd(SW) # standard deviation of Sepal Width
```

As we can see, these flowers have similar sepal width, but they differ widely in
petal length. This is consistent with the boxplot above. Perhaps changes in
petal length lead to better survival in different habitats.

With R, it is easy to generate graphs. 
```{r out.width='80%', fig.cap='Barplot of petal length.', fig.align='center'}
barplot(PL) # bar plot of Petal Length
```

This figure suggests that the first 50 flowers (iris setosa) have much shorter
petals than the other two species. The last 50 flowers (iris virginica) have
slightly longer petals than those of iris versicolor.

(ref:1-4) Scatter plot, histogram, lag plot and normal Q-Q plot. 

```{r 1-4, echo=c(1, 4, 6, 9, 10), fig.show='hold', out.width='50%', fig.cap='(ref:1-4)', fig.align='center'}
plot(PL) # Run scatter plot
legend("topleft", inset = .02, cex = 2, legend = "plot(PL)", box.lty = 0)
title("Scatter plot of Petal Length")
hist(PL) # histogram
legend(1.6, 36, cex = 2, legend = "hist(PL)", box.lty = 0)
lag.plot(PL) # lag plot
legend("topleft", inset = .02, cex = 2, legend = "lag.plot(PL)", box.lty = 0)
title("Lag plot of Pental Length")
qqnorm(PL) # Q-Q plot for normal distribution
qqline(PL) # add the regression line
legend("topleft", inset = .02, cex = 2, legend = "qqnorm(PL)", box.lty = 0)
```
There are three different groups in the scatter plot. The petal length of one group is much smaller than the other two groups.

Histogram shows the distribution of data by plotting the frequency of data in bins.
The histogram top right of Figure \@ref(fig:1-4) shows that there are more flowers
with Petal Length between 1 cm and 1.5 cm. It also shows that the data does not show a bell-curved distribution.

The lag plot is a scatter plot against the same set of number with an offset of
1. Any structure in a lag plot indicates non-randomness in the order in which
the data is presented. We can clearly see three  clusters, indicating that
values are centered around three levels sequentially.

Q-Q (quantile-quantile) plots can help check if data follows a Normal distribution, which is widely observed in many situations. 
It is the pre-requisite for many statistical methods. See Figure \@ref(fig:1-5) for an example of normal distribution. 
Quantiles of the data is compared against those in a normal distribution. If the data points on a Q-Q plot form a straight line, 
the data has a normal distribution.

```

```


We can do a one-sample t-test for the mean of a normally distributed data. 
Suppose the pental length of the species *setosa*, the first 50 observations of *PL*, 
follows a normal distribution. We want to test if its mean is different from 1.5 cm at the significance level $\alpha = 0.05$. 
Below is the code for the testing.
```{r}
t.test(PL[1:50], mu = 1.5) # two sided t-test for the mean of petal length of setosa
```

In this case, our null hypothesis is that the mean of petal length of *setosa* is 1.5 cm. 
Since p-value 0.1282 is greater than the significance level 0.05, 
there is no strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. 
This function also tells us the 95% confidence interval for the mean. 
Based on our sample of the 50 observations, we have 95% confidence to conclude 
that the mean of petal length of setosa (if we were to measure all setosa in the world) 
is between 1.412645 cm and 1.511355 cm. 

>
```{exercise}

>
Compute 95% confidence interval of sepal length of setosa.
```


We can perform a hypothesis test on whether a set of numbers are derived from normal distribution. 
When interpreting results from hypothesis testing, it is important to state 
the null hypothesis is. Here the null hypothesis is that the data is from a normal distribution. 
```{r}
# normality test 
shapiro.test(PL)
```

If petal length is normally distributed, there is only 7.412×10^-10^ chance of getting the observed test statistic of 0.87627. In other words, it is highly unlikely that petal length follows a normal distribution. We reject the normal distribution hypothesis, which could be corroborated by our plots above. 

```{r}
# normality test of  the first 50 observations of PL
shapiro.test(PL[1:50])
```
Given the significance level $\alpha=0.05$, the p-value of normality test for the pental length of setosa is 0.05481 which is greater than 0.05. 
Then we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that we don't have  evidence to reject the hypthoses 
that the pental length of setosa follows a normal distribution. 
In statistics, we rely on both charts and statistical models to draw a conclusion.

```




## Analyzing a categorical variable

In the iris dataset, the last column contains the species information. We call this a **categorical variable**. 
Bar and Pie charts are very effective in showing proportions. We can see that the three species are each represented with 50 observations.
```{r echo=c(1, 2, 3, 5), fig.show='hold', out.width='50%', fig.cap='Frequencies of categorical values visualized by Pie chart (A) and bar chart (B).', fig.align='center'}
counts <- table(iris$Species) # tabulate the frequencies
counts
pie(counts) # pie chart
legend("topleft", inset = .02, legend = "A", box.lty = 0)
barplot(counts) # bar plot
text(3.71, 48, labels = "B")
```


## The relationship between two numerical variables 
Scatter plot is very effective in visualizing the correlation between two columns of numbers. 

(ref:2-1) Scatter plot of petal width and petal length.

```{r 2-1, message=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap='(ref:2-1)', fig.align='center'}
PW <- iris$Petal.Width # just lazy
plot(PW, PL) # scatterplot of pental width vs pental length
```

Figure \@ref(fig:2-1) shows that there is a positive correlation between petal
length and petal width. In other words, flowers with longer petals are often
wider. So the petals are getting bigger substantially when both dimensions
increase.

Another unusual feature is that there seem to be two clusters of points. Do the
points in the small cluster represent one particular species of iris? We need to
further investigate this. The following will produce a plot with the species
information color-coded. The resultant Figure \@ref(fig:2-2) clearly shows that
indeed one particular species, *setosa* constitutes the smaller cluster in
the low left. The other two species also show a difference in this plot, even
though they are not easily separated. This is a very important insight into this
dataset.

(ref:2-2) Scatter plot shows the correlation of petal width and petal length.

```{r 2-2, echo = c(1,2,3),out.width='80%', fig.cap='(ref:2-2)', fig.align='center'}
SP <- as.factor(iris$Species)
plot(PW, PL, col = SP) # change colors based on Species
legend("topleft", levels(SP), fill = 1:3) # add legends on topleft.
abline(lm(PL ~ PW))
```


To change the color for a specific data point, we defined a new variable SP
by converting the last column into a **factor**. 
The function **str(SP)** shows that the SP is a
factor with 3 levels which are internally coded as 1, 2, and 3. 
This enables us to use these as color codes. This kind of base plotting has been simplified by 
modern systems such as ggplot2, which we will discuss later. So you do not have to remember any of this.

```{r}
str(SP) # show the structure of Species.
```

Perhaps due to adaption to the environment, change in petal length leads to
better survival. With the smallest petals, *setosa* is found in Arctic
regions. *versicolor* is often found in the Eastern United States and
Eastern Canada. *virginica* "is common along the coastal plain from Florida
to Georgia in the Southeastern United States--*Wikipedia*." It appears the iris
flowers in warmer places are much larger than those in colder ones. With R, it
is very easy to generate lots of graphics. But we still have to do the thinking.
It requires us to interpret the charts in the context.

b. Add legend to the top right.
```


We can quantitatively characterize the strength of the correlation using several types of correlation coefficients, 
such as Pearson’s correlation coefficient.  It ranges from -1 to 1.   Zero means no linear correlation.
```{r}
cor(PW, PL)
```

This means the petal width and petal length are strongly and positively correlated. we can add this information to the plot as text:
```{r eval=FALSE}
text(1.5, 1.5, paste("R=0.96"))
```


```{r}
cor.test(PW, PL)
```

Through hypothesis testing, we reject the null hypothesis that the true correlation is zero (no correlation). 
That means the correlation is statistically significant.
Note that Pearson’s correlation coefficient is not robust against outliers 
and other methods such as Spearman’s exists. See help info:
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
?cor # show help info on the function of cor()
```
We can also determine the equation that links petal length and petal width. This is so called regression analysis. We assume

   $Petal.Length = \alpha × Petal.Width + c + \epsilon$,

where $\alpha$ is the slope parameter, $c$ is a constant, and $\epsilon$ is some random error.   This linear model can be determined by a method that minimizes the least squared-error:
```{r}
model <- lm(PL ~ PW) # Linear Model (lm)
summary(model) # shows the details
```

Note that in the regression model, the tilde(~) links a response variable 
on the left with one or more independent variables on the right side.
It is a shortcut for an operator. We are defining a statistical model where
the PL is modeled as a function of PW. In addition to regression models, we also use formula in plots.


As we can see, we estimated that $\alpha=2.22944$ and $c=1.08356$. Both parameters are significantly 
different from zero as the p-values are <2×10^-16^ in both cases. In other words, we can reliably predict 

$Petal.Length = 2.22944 × Petal.Width + 1.08356$.

This model can be put on the scatter plot as a line.
```{r fig.keep='none', eval = FALSE}
abline(model) # add regression line to plot.
```

And we can get the diagnostic plots for regression analysis:
```{r fig.keep='none', eval = FALSE}
plot(model) # diagnostic plots for regression
```
Sometimes, we use this type of regression analysis to investigate whether variables are significantly associated.

## Testing the differences between two groups
Are boys taller than girls of the same age? Such situations are common. 
We have measurements of a random **sample** from a **population**. From the sample we want 
to know if the observed differences among the two groups 
reflect real differences in the population or due to random sampling error.   

(ref:2-4) Boxplot of petal length, grouped by species.

```{r  message=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap='(ref:2-4)', fig.align='center'}
Species <- iris$Species
# Comparing distributions of petal length of the three species by boxplot
boxplot(PL ~ Species)
```
Here, R automatically split the dataset into three groups according to Species and created a boxplot for each. 

From the boxplot, it is obvious that *Setosa* has much shorter petals. Are there differences between *versicolor* and *virginica* significant? 
We only had a small sample of 50 flowers for each species. But we want to draw some conclusion about the two species in general. We could measure all the iris flowers across the world; Or we could use statistics to make inference. Let's extract corresponding data.
```{r results='hide'}
PL1 <- PL[51:100] # extract Petal Length of versicolor
PL1 # a vector with 50 numbers
PL2 <- PL[101:150] # extract Petal length of virginica
PL2 # y contain 50 measurements
```

```{r fig.keep='none'}
boxplot(PL1, PL2) # a boxplot of the two groups of values
t.test(PL1, PL2) # two sample t-test
```
In this two sample t-test, our null hypothesis is that the mean of petal length for *versicolor* is the same as *virginica*. A small p-value of 2.2x10^-16^ indicates under this hypothesis, it is extremely unlikely to observe the difference of 1.292cm through random sampling. Hence we reject that hypothesis and conclude that the means for the two species are significantly different. If we measure all *versicolor* and *virginica* flowers in the world and compute their average petal lengths, it is very likely that the two averages are different. On the other hand, if the p-value is larger than a given significance level, let's say $\alpha = 0.05$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that we don't have strong evidence to reject the means are same. 

We actually do not need to separate two set of numbers into two data objects in order to do a t-test. We can do it right within the data frame. R can separate data points by columns.
```{r results='hide', fig.keep='none'}
# Extract observations of versicolor which are lined at rows from 51 to 150
df <- iris[51:150, ]
t.test(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = df) # t-test
boxplot(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = droplevels(df)) # removes empty levels in Species
```

## Testing the difference among multiple groups (ANOVA)
As indicated by Figure \@ref(fig:2-5), sepal width has small variation across species. We want to know if the means of sepal width for the 3 species are same or not. This can be done through Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).

(ref:2-5) Boxplot of sepal width across 3 species.

```{r 2-5, echo=c(1:3), fig.cap='(ref:2-5)', fig.align='center'}
SW <- iris$Sepal.Width
boxplot(SW ~ SP)
summary(aov(SW ~ SP))
```
Since p-value is much smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. We can conclude that not all the 3 species have the same mean of sepal width. In other words, there are at least two of the species have different means of sepal width. This is the only thing we can conclude from  this, since this is how the hypothesis was set up. The boxplot in Figure \@ref(fig:2-5) seems to indicate  that *setosa* has wider sepals.

I hope this give you some idea about what it is like to use R to visualize and analyze data. It is interactive and graphical. 
If I made you feel it is complicated, I failed as a instructor. 
Most people can learn R themselves by working on a small dataseet of their interest. 
Just Google everything and keep trying.
