Instead of explaining the rules, the book largely centers on the analysis of several datasets from the very beginning. So this is an alternative to traditional, more rigorous textbooks on R programming. We start with small and clean datasets and gradually transition into big, messy ones. With each dataset, we hope to tell a story through the analysis. We invite you, our courageous reader, to take on this journey with us. Motivated readers, such as biologists, could easily work their way through this book and learn by themselves. I would encourage you to type in the example code and see the outputs. And then work on the challenges and exercises. It originally started as materials for 2-hour hands-on workshops intended to give a quick introduction/demonstration for students and researchers who are totally new to R. The workshop has been given many times to different audiences ranging from high-school students to mathematicians. For a 2-hour session, I have to keep it gentle, interactive, and fun, sometimes at the expense of rigor. Instead of explaining all the rules, grammar, and syntax, I found it is easier to focus on one dataset and walk them through some of the analyses possible with R. This material later evolved into as a one-credit online class and then a three credit class. We stick with the unconventional approach of focusing on datasets and examples. Many students have contributed to this material. Notably, Quazi Irfan who worked as teaching assistant, fixed many errors and gave constructive feedback. In the fall of 2018, a group of highly motivated students in the STAT 442 Exploratory Data Analysis worked on some of the datasets presented here. They are Samuel Ivanecky, Kory Heier, Audrey Bunge, Jacie McDonald, Shae Olson, Nathan Thirsten, and Alex Wieseler. Some of the plots in this book are inspired by them.
