Data frames. The absolute basics: import data, check data types, attach, and then plot and analyze using column names. 1.1 Getting started (Trail: Delete this in a few minutes) Install R from www.R-project.org. Choose the cloud server or any U.S. mirror site. Install RStudio Desktop from www.RStudio.com. Rstudio uses the R software in the background but provides a more user-friendly interface. R commands can be typed directly into the “Console” window. Or you can enter them in the “R Script” window and click the “Run” button. If you have an older version of R or Rstudio, I will recommend upgrading to the new version. Alternatively, you can use R and Rstudio through a web browser via Rstudio Cloud. Some universities also host their own Rstudio server on more powerful computers. As a quick sample session, let’s try all of these commands below in the Console window. If you understand all of these, you probably do not need this book. Consider more advanced books like R for Data Science. If it takes a few months to type these 243 characters, try www.RapidTyping.com first. head(iris) str(iris) summary(iris) x &lt;- iris[, 1:4] head(x) boxplot(x) plot(x[, 3:4]) abline( lm(x[, 4] ~ x[, 3]) ) pairs(x) stars(x) PL &lt;- x$Petal.Length PL barplot(PL) hist(PL) Species &lt;- iris$Species Species pie( table(Species) ) boxplot(PL ~ Species ) summary( aov(PL ~ Species) ) Animated GIF for screen shot. 1.2 Data frames have rows and columns: the Iris flower dataset In 1936, Edgar Anderson collected data to quantify the geographic variation of Iris flowers. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of the three sub-species ( Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the lengths and the widths of sepals and petals, in centimeters (cm). This data is included in R software. Download this dataset from GitHub, and open it in Excel. Have a quick look at the data, think about what distinguishes the three species? If we have a flower with sepals of 6.5cm long and 3.0cm wide, petals of 6.2cm long, and 2.2cm wide, which species does it most likely belong to? Think (!) for a few minutes while eyeballing the data at Wikipedia. Getting familiar with this dataset is vital to follow this book. Figure 1.1: Iris flower. Photo from Wikipedia. The downloaded iris data can be imported into R by selecting Import Dataset in the File menu, and then choose “From text(readr)…”. As the default settings work well in this case, we just need to click Import in the pop-up window. That’s it! There is no need to spend half of a semester to learn how to import data like some people used to complain about SAS. If you have trouble importin this data file, you can skip this step as this data set is included in the R software. Figure 1.2: Example of a data frame. To answer these questions, let’s visualize and analyze the data with R. Type these commands without the comments after “#”. iris # print the whole dataset dim(iris) # show the dimension of the data frame head(iris) # show the first few rows str(iris) # show the structure class(iris) ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; While the first 4 columns contain numeric values, the 5th column contains characters indicating which sub-species a sample belongs to. This is an important distinction, as they are treated differently in R. Sometimes we need to overwrite data types guessed by R, which can be done during the data importing process The imported data is stored in a data frame called iris, which contains both numeric and character columns. Individual values in a data frame can be accessed using row and column indices. Another data structure is a matrix which contains only one type of variables. More discussion about data frame, matrix, and other data structures are introduced in the later chapters. iris[3, 4] # shows the value in 3rd row, 4th column: 0.2. iris[3, ] # shows all of row 3 iris[, 4] # shows all of column 4 iris[3, 1:4] # shows row 3, columns 1 to 4 To do the exercises, you need to creat a new Word document. Then copy and paste the R code and results to the Word document. Save it as a PDF file. Submit both the Word and PDF files to the Dropbox. Exercise 1.1 Type data() in the R Console window. The pop-up window - R data sets - contain all built-in data sets in package ‘datasets’. Choose a data set whose structure is data frame, then answer the following questions: Display the first few rows of the data set. NOT all values in your data set. Show the dimension of the data set. Extract a subset which contains values in the 2nd through the 5th rows and the 1st through the 4th columns. If your data set contains fewer rows or columns, please choose another data set. You can replace the iris data set with any of the built-in data sets as long as its data structure is data frame. Make sure you check the structure of the data set by the class() function. Note: You will need to change the variable names and ranges of rows and columns. colnames(iris) # Column names. ## [1] &quot;Sepal.Length&quot; &quot;Sepal.Width&quot; &quot;Petal.Length&quot; &quot;Petal.Width&quot; &quot;Species&quot; Remember these column names, as we are going to use them in our analysis now. Note that sepal length information is contained in the column named Sepal.Length. Since R is case sensitive, we have to type these column names exactly as above. R is case-sensitive. “iris$petal.length” will not be recognized. We can retrieve an entire column by using the data frame name followed by the column name. iris$Petal.Length # The 150 numbers in the Petal length column This is the recommended, safer way of referring to columns. But if you are as lazy as me and do not want to type the data frame name repeatedly. This is a shortcut by attaching a data frame the columns can be accessed directly. One disadvantage is that it will be cause issues if two datasets have the same variable names, or if the data is transformed. We typically do not recommend doing it but here we want to make things simple. attach(iris) Petal.Length # The 150 numbers in the Petal length column mean(Petal.Length) # mean( ) is a function that operates on Petal.Length ## [1] 3.758 Exercise 1.2 Compute the mean of the sepal length in the data set iris. Compute the mean of speed in the built-in data set cars. The best way to learn about other R functions is Google search. Exercise 1.3 Google “R square root function” to find the R function, and compute the value of \\(\\sqrt{56.7}\\). Use R to find the maximal value of mpg in the data set mtcars. 1.3 Analyzing one set of numbers First, let’s retrieve the 150 in the nubmerspetal length column and store it in an vector called x. x &lt;- Petal.Length Some might complain that nothing happens after you type in this command. Although nothing is printed out, you have created a new vector called x in the memory. You can find it in the top right panel in the Environment tab. The process of programming is all about creating and modifying data objects; these data objects can be printed out or operated on. A vector holds a series of values, such as numbers and characters. R made it very easy to do the same calculations (add, subtract, multiply,…) on all of them at once or collectively. summary(x) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 1.000 1.600 4.350 3.758 5.100 6.900 This produces a lot of useful information. The minimum petal length is 1.0, and the maximum is 6.9. Average petal length is 3.758. The mid-point, or median, is 5.35, as about half of the numbers are smaller than 5.35. Why the median is different from the mean? What happens if there is a typo and one number is entered 340cm instead of 3.40cm? The 3rd quartile, or 75th percentile, is 5.1, as 75% of the flowers have petals shorter than 5.1. If a student’s GPA ranks 5th in a class of 25, he/she is at 80th percentile. The 1st quartile, or 25th percentile, is 1.6. Only 25% of the flowers have petals shorter than 1.6. These summary statistics are graphically represented as a boxplot in the Figure &lt;span class=“redoc” id=“redoc-citation-1”&gt;(???)(fig:1-3)A. Boxplots are more useful when multiple sets of numbers are compared. boxplot(x) # Figure 1.3A. boxplot(iris[, 1:4]) # boxplot Figure 1.3B. Figure 1.3: Boxplot of petal length (A) and of all 4 columns (B). In Rstudio, you can copy a plot to the clipboard using the Export button on top of the plot area. Or you can click zoom, right click on the popup plot and select “Copy Image”. Then you can paste the plot into Word. If you are using native R software, instead of Rstudio, you can right-click on the plots and copy as meta-file. Exercise 1.4 a. Check the data structure of the built-in data set mtcars. b. Get the boxplot of Mile Per Gallon (mpg) in the data set mtcars. To quantify the variance, we can compute the standard deviation σ: \\[\\begin{align} σ=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1}[(x_{1}-\\bar x)^2+(x_{2}-\\bar x)^2+...+(x_{N}-\\bar x)^2]} \\end{align}\\] where \\[\\begin{align} \\bar x=\\frac{1}{N}(x_{1}+x_{2}+...x_{N}) \\end{align}\\] If all the measurements are close to the mean (µ), then standard deviation should be small. sd(x) # standard deviation ## [1] 1.765298 sd(Sepal.Width) ## [1] 0.4358663 As we can see, these flowers have similar sepal width, but they differ widely in petal length. This is consistent with the boxplot above. Perhaps changes in petal length lead to better survival in different habitats. With R, it is easy to generate graphs. barplot(x) Figure 1.4: Barplot of petal length This figure suggests that the first 50 flowers (Iris setosa) have much shorter petals than the other two species. The last 50 flowers (Iris virginica) have slightly longer petals than the middle (Iris versicolor). plot(x) # Run sequence plot hist(x) # histogram lag.plot(x) qqnorm(x) # Q-Q plot for normal distribution qqline(x) Figure 1.5: Sequence plot, histogram, lag plot and normal Q-Q plot. Histogram shows the distribution of data. The histogram top right of Figure 1.5 shows that there are more flowers with Petal Length between 1 and 1.5. It also shows that the data does not show a bell-curved distribution. The lag plot is a scatter plot against the same set of number with an offset of 1. Any structure in a lag plot indicates non-randomness in the order in which the data is presented. We can clearly see three big clusters, indicating that values are centered around three levels sequentially. Q-Q plot can help check if data follows a Gaussian distribution, which is widely observed in many situations. Also referred to as normal distribution, it is the pre-requisite for many statistical methods. See Figure 1.6 for an example of normal distribution. Quantiles of the data is compared against those in a normal distribution. If the data points on a Q-Q plot form a straight line, the data has a normal distribution. Exercise 1.5 a. Run x = rnorm(500) to generate 500 random numbers following the Standard Normal distribution b. generate scatter plot, histogram, lag plot, and Q-Q plot. Your plots should like those in Figure 1.6. Figure 1.6: Plots for randomly generated numbers following a normal distribution. Exercise 1.6 Generate scatter plot, histogram, lag plot, and Q-Q plot for the Septal length in the iris dataset. We can also do a one-sample t-test of mean: t.test(Sepal.Length, mu = 5.8) ## ## One Sample t-test ## ## data: Sepal.Length ## t = 0.64092, df = 149, p-value = 0.5226 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 5.8 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 5.709732 5.976934 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x ## 5.843333 In this case, our hypothesis is that the true average of sepal length for all iris flowers is 5.8. Since p-value is quite big, we accept this hypothesis. This function also tells us the 95% confidence interval on the mean. Based on our sample of 150 iris flowers, we are 95% confident that the true mean is between 5.71 and 5.98. Exercise 1.7 Compute 95% confidence interval of petal length. We can perform hypothesis testing on whether a set of numbers derived from normal distribution. The null hypothesis is that the data is from a normal distribution. shapiro.test(Petal.Length) ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: Petal.Length ## W = 0.87627, p-value = 7.412e-10 If petal length is normally distributed, there is only 7.412×10-10 chance of getting a test statistic of 0.87627, which is observed in our sample of 150 flowers. In other words, it is highly unlikely that petal length follows a normal distribution. We reject the normal distribution hypothesis. Exercise 1.8 a. Run Shapiro’s test on sepal width. Does it follow a normal distribution given the significant level is 0.05? b. Generate histogram and Q-Q plot for sepal width. Do the plots show a Normal approximation? 1.4 Analyzing a column of categorical values In the iris dataset, the last column contains the species information. These are “string” values or categorical values. counts &lt;- table(Species) # tabulate the frequencies counts ## Species ## setosa versicolor virginica ## 50 50 50 pie(counts) # See Figure 1.7A barplot(counts) # See Figure 1.7B Figure 1.7: Frequencies of categorical values visualized by Pie chart (A) and bar chart (B). Pie charts are very effective in showing proportions. We can see that the three species are each represented with 50 observations. 1.5 Analyzing the relationship between two sets of numbers Scatter plot is very effective in visualizing the correlation between two columns of numbers. x &lt;- Petal.Width # just lazy y &lt;- Petal.Length plot(x, y) # scatterplot, refined version in Figure 1.9 Figure 1.8: Scatter plot of petal width and petal length. Figure 1.8 shows that there is a positive correlation between petal length and petal width. In other words, flowers with longer petals are often wider. So the petals are getting bigger substantially when both dimensions increase. Another unusual feature is that there seem to be two clusters of points. Do the points in the small cluster represent one particular species of Iris? We need to further investigate this. The following will produce a plot with the species information color-coded. The resultant Figure 1.9 clearly shows that indeed one particular species, I. setosa constitutes the smaller cluster in the low left. The other two species also show a difference in this plot, even though they are not easily separated. This is a very important insight into this dataset. plot(x, y, col = rainbow(3)[Species]) # change colors based on Species legend(&quot;topleft&quot;, levels(Species), fill = rainbow(3)) # add legends on topleft. Figure 1.9: Scatter plot shows the correlation of petal width and petal length. There are 3 species, therefore we select 3 for the rainbow() function. The 3 colors will correspond the 3 species. The class(Species) returns the data structure of Species is a “factor”. The levels(Species) function shows all levels of Species. The function str(Species) shows that the Species is a factor with 3 levels which are internally coded as 1, 2, and 3. class(Species) # Show the data structure of Species. ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; levels(Species) # Show all levels of a factor variable. ## [1] &quot;setosa&quot; &quot;versicolor&quot; &quot;virginica&quot; str(Species) # show the structure of Species. ## Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;setosa&quot;,&quot;versicolor&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... Perhaps due to adaption to the environment, change in petal length leads to better survival. With the smallest petals, Iris Setosa is found in Arctic regions. Iris versicolor is often found in the Eastern United States and Eastern Canada. Iris virginica “is common along the coastal plain from Florida to Georgia in the Southeastern United States \\[Wikipedia\\].” It appears the iris flowers in warmer places are much larger than those in colder ones. With R, it is very easy to generate lots of graphics. But we still have to do the thinking. It requires to put the plots in context. Exercise 1.9 The mtcars data description can be found here: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/RHOME/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html. Based on mtcars data set, plot a scatter plot which shows the correlation between Miles/(US) gallon and Displacement (cu.in.). In this data set, the type of cyl is numeric. You will need to use function newcyl -&gt; factor(cyl) to transfer the type to factor. Then replace all mtcars$cyl with newcyl. Color the scatter plot by Number of cylinders; Add legend to the top right. We can quantitatively characterize the strength of the correlation using several types of correlation coefficients, such as Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r. It ranges from -1 to 1. cor(x, y) ## [1] 0.9628654 This means the petal width and petal length are strongly and positively correlated. cor.test(x, y) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: x and y ## t = 43.387, df = 148, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.9490525 0.9729853 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.9628654 Through hypothesis testing of the correlation, we reject the null hypothesis that the true correlation is zero. That means the correlation is statistically significant. Note that Pearson’s correlation coefficient is not robust against outliers and other methods such as Spearman’s exists. See help info: ?cor # show help info on cor ( ) We can also determine the equation that links petal length and petal width. This is so called regression analysis. We assume $Petal.Length = a × Petal.Width + c + e$, where \\(a\\) is the slope parameter, \\(c\\) is a constant, and \\(e\\) is some random error. This linear model can be determined by a method that minimizes the least squared-error: model &lt;- lm(y ~ x) # Linear Model (lm) summary(model) # shows the details ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = y ~ x) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.33542 -0.30347 -0.02955 0.25776 1.39453 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) ## (Intercept) 1.08356 0.07297 14.85 &lt;2e-16 *** ## x 2.22994 0.05140 43.39 &lt;2e-16 *** ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## ## Residual standard error: 0.4782 on 148 degrees of freedom ## Multiple R-squared: 0.9271, Adjusted R-squared: 0.9266 ## F-statistic: 1882 on 1 and 148 DF, p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16 As we can see, we estimated that a=2.22944 and c=1.08356. Both parameters are significantly different from zero as the p-values are &lt;2×10-16 in both cases. In other words, we can reliably predict \\(Petal.Length = 2.22944 × Petal.Width + 1.08356\\). This model can be put on the scatter plot as a line. plot(model) abline(model) # add regression line to plot. Figure 1.8. Sometimes, we use this type of regression analysis to investigate whether variables are associated. Exercise 1.10 Investigate the relationship between sepal length and sepal width using scatter plots, correlation coefficients, test of correlation, and linear regression. Again interpret all your results in PLAIN and proper English. 1.6 Testing the differences between two groups Are boys taller than girls of the same age? Such situations are common. We have measurements of two groups of objects and want to know if the observed differences are real or due to random sampling error. boxplot(Petal.Length ~ Species) Figure 1.10: Boxplot of petal length, grouped by species. From the boxplot, it is obvious that I. Setosa has much shorter petals. But are there significant differences between I. versicolor and I. virginica? We only had a small sample of 50 flowers for each species. But we want to draw some conclusion about the two species in general. We could measure all the iris flowers across the world; Or we could use statistics to make inference. First we need to extract these data x &lt;- Petal.Length[51:100] # extract Petal Length of iris versicolor x # x contain 50 measurements y &lt;- Petal.Length[101:150] # extract Petal length of iris virginica y # y contain 50 measurements boxplot(x, y) # a boxplot of the two groups of values t.test(x, y) ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: x and y ## t = -12.604, df = 95.57, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -1.49549 -1.08851 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 4.260 5.552 In this student’s t-test, our null hypothesis is that the mean petal length is the same for I. versicolor and I. virginica. A small p-value of 2.2x10-16 indicates under this hypothesis, it is extremely unlikely to observe the difference of 1.292cm through random sampling. Hence we reject that hypothesis and conclude that the true mean is different. If we measure all I. versicolor and I. virginica flowers in the world and compute their true average petal lengths, it is very likely that the two averages will differ. On the other hand, if p-value is larger than a threshold, typically 0.05, we will accept the null hypothesis and conclude that real average petal length is the same. We actually do not need to separate two set of numbers into two data objects in order to do t-test or compare them side-by-side on one plot. We can do it right within the data frame. R can separate data points by another column. x2 &lt;- iris[51:150, ] # Extract rows 51 to 150 t.test(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = x2) # t-test boxplot(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = droplevels(x2)) #removes empty levels in Species Exercise 1.11 Use boxplot and t-test to investigate whether sepal width is different between I. versicolor and I. virginica. Interpret your results. 1.7 Testing the difference among multiple groups (ANOVA) As indicated by Figure ??, sepal width has small variation across species. We want to know if the mean sepal width is the same across 3 species. This is done through Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). boxplot(Sepal.Width ~ Species) # Figure 1.12 Figure 1.11: Boxplot of sepal width across 3 species. summary(aov(Sepal.Width ~ Species)) ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## Species 2 11.35 5.672 49.16 &lt;2e-16 *** ## Residuals 147 16.96 0.115 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 Since p-value is much smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. The mean sepal width is not the same for 3 species. This is the only thing we can conclude from this. The boxplot in Figure 1.11 seems to indicate that I. Setosa has wider sepals. Exercise 1.12 Use boxplot and ANOVA to investigate whether petal width is the same among three subspecies. I hope this give you some idea about what it is like to using R to visualize and analyze data. It is interactive and graphical interface make it easy to manipulate data. "]
